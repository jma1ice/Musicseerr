"""Regression tests for categorize_lidarr_albums de-duplication.

Lidarr can report the same release group more than once (or with no
foreignAlbumId at all). When those reach the frontend they collide as
duplicate keys in the keyed {#each} that renders releases, which throws
svelte's each_key_duplicate and blanks the whole artist page. The
categoriser must therefore drop id-less and duplicate albums, mirroring the
MusicBrainz path's `if item.id and item.id not in seen_mbids` guard.
